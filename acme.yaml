# List of domains and the corresponding challenge mechanisms
domains:
  # Domain names are always terminated by a ".". The certificate domain is matched via a suffix match.
  # E.g. "www.mydomain.org" matches "mydomain.org." (the "." is handled automatically).
  # Therefore domain name "." represents a catch-all clauss. In case of multiple matches, the longest match is used.
